# iOS “Wheaton Connect” App: 
(2 developers)
This is a networking app with a UI similar to Instagram and its purpose is to aid campus groups and clubs in informing the student body of upcoming events.

It is built on top of Firebase and it uses Google Authentication for sign in features.

The app has three user groups:
1. Club Account Managers
  - These users can sign in, customize the club profile page, view past posts and posts of other clubs, create posts, and request to have the posts published to the public feed by sending a request to the college Admin user

2. Admin User
  - This user monitors, approves, and denies all club event postings by running an account with admin priveleges
  
3. Generic Users (Student Body)
  - Generic users can us the app without logging in (aka loggin in anonymously), but they can only see the main public feed which includes posts that have already been approved by the Admin User. They can also filter posts by searching for a specific club, date, or topic.
