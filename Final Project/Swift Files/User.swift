//Task 4: Creating a User Class
//It is important to note that one could sign in without a user class
//because firebase authentication stores an email and password by
//default for the login that we choose. We could retrieve the
// email and password for the current user by making the function call
//Auth.auth().curentUser, but since we want to associate a username
//with that email and password as well, we will create a class to hold
//that all authentication info and we will store that info in the database
